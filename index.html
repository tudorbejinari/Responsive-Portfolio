       <p>Hello, my name is Tudor and my friends are calling me “Double Door”. I’m 31 years old anmarried (unfortunately :) ).I currently work at Rennaisance Hotel. Why? Because it took me 10 years to figure out what I really want to do in this life.
                My primary goal is to be happy regardless of what I choose to do. An important objective in life is to pursue a career in the IT field which will open up new doors and opportunities. 
                That’s why I decided to go through The Coding Bootcamp. This Bootcamp is also challenge for me. I really want to see what I’m capable to do. I consider myself life-long learner, and with IT industry that is changing constantly there is always a room to learn something new. My strengths are: I can work well and cooperate with others, I can view problems through multiple lenses,I have strong math skills, and the most important I have a lot of patience. I would like to work one day for one of the best IT companies like  Google, Amazon, Facebook. Just kidding I wasn’t born a "nerd".<br>
                I believe in “American Dream”. I want to have a beautiful family and two kids. I want to build my house and to plant a tree. I want to be happy and successful. MY MOTTO: FOLLOW YOUR PASSION. FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS. BELIEVE YOU CAN AND YOU WILL.</p>
